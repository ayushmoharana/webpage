    content: `Compact Hierarchical Triples (CHT) are systems with the tertiary star orbiting the inner binary in an orbit shorter than 1000 days. These systems were thought to be rare before, but with Kepler  and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) we have been discovering more of these systems. CHT with an eclipsing binary as its inner binary can help us extract the orbital, stellar and atmospheric properties of all the stars in the system. Using these parameters, I constrain the evolution of these stars and also check their future dynamical evolution. I work on low-mass CHTs (atleast 2 companions are near 1 solar mass) as they could help help draw parallels to formation and evolution of brown-dwarfs and exoplanets.
                To acheive this, I use multiple analyses and techniques in my work:
                1. lightcurve modelling (PHOEBE2, JKTEBOP)
                2. radial velocity extraction (TODCOR, broadening functions)
                3. radial velocity modelling (PHOEBE2, Radvel)s
                4. spectral disentangling (fd3)
                5. spectral analysis (iSpec)
                6. Isochrone fitting
                7. Numerical integration of orbital dynamics

These hot stars are bright in UV and belong to the evolved stages of stellar evolution, i.e, Horizontal Branch (HB), Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) and Blue Straggler Stars (BSS). 

            For this work that started during my Mastersâ€™, I use observations from the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope  (link<http://www.iiap.res.in/uvit.htm><UVIT>) which is onboard the space-observatory ASTROSAT and is operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation.`,

    content: `When there is a companion star to an eclipsing binary, the eclipses are perturbed from their periodic nature. By measuring these small perturbations, we can estimate the orbits and the mass of the companion. Further, a careful characterisation of the signal can tell us about the apsidal motion, mass transfer and spot variations in the eclipsing binary.

    I work with the link<http://projektsolaris.pl/en/homepage/><Solaris> (PI: Prof. M. Konacki) network of robotic telescopes to obtain ETVs for a large sample of eclipsing binaries. I have also created the photometric pipeline to extract light curves from 5 years of observations using 4 telescopes and 2 filters for over 100 targets.`,
